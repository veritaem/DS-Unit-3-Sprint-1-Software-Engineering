An even better help is when someone tests a part out.  Without that it feels more like someone guessing offhand about your code, and thats not good.  Another thing that is appreciated is when both people have their code done. Having only half of the code theyve been working on for someone to review basically puts you in the spot of being useless except to offer some small tidbits like adding comments or some neatness issues.   \n",

Sometimes there is a fear of something gumming up other programs or being poorly executed. it doesnt hurt to throw certain things in a container and let them run themselves for a while to see how they are.  For particularly delicate things like learning models, youre less worried about them affecting other things so much as other things affecting them, even.
